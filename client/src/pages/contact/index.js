      this is where you can find a form to send us an email. We are very
      friendly and value your input a lot maybe. Here are our operating hours,
      but not our phone number because that's stupid. Email forms work best.
      Maybe one day we will have a phone service for peopel to call, but who's
      that fancy from the getout? Not me for sure for sure
